			<p>The zodiac (which is derived from the Greek word meaning "circle of animals") is believed to have developed in ancient Egypt and later adopted by the Babylonians. Early astrologers knew it took 12 lunar cycles (i.e., months) for the sun to return to its original position. They then identified 12 constellations that they observed were linked to the progression of the seasons and assigned them names of certain animals and persons (in Babylonia, for example, the rainy season was found to occur when the Sun was in a particular constellation which was then named Aquarius, or water bearer).
			The signs of the zodiac are subdivided into four groups:</p>
			<lu>
				<li>Fire Signs: Aries, Sagittarius, Leo</li>
				<li>Water Signs: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces</li>
				<li>Air Signs: Libra, Aquarius, Gemini</li>
				<li>Earth Signs: Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo</li>
			</lu>

		<p>Each of these four groups is inscribed in its own quadrant, or group of "houses," on a circle. The division of the 12 houses is based on Earth's daily rotation and relates to such circumstances as relationships, finances, travel, etc. The division of the 12 signs of the zodiac, on the other hand, is based on the earth's year-long rotation around the Sun and relates to character traits and areas of life (e.g., Venus represents affection, Mercury represents speech and writing, etc.). Each planet is associated with two signs, and the Sun and Moon with one each.
